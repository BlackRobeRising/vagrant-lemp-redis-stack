# Vagrant LEMP Stack w/ Redis
Default LEMP development VM for testing/hobby development.

## Usage:
 * Download and install Vagrant and VirtualBox from http://vagrantup.com and https://www.virtualbox.org/ respectively. If you are using linux, use the packages appropriate to your distro as sometimes you can get weird bugs with downloading them from their respective sites. [e.g. I had an issue where Vagrant + Virtualbox = Reboot randomly, from packages it was fine.]
 * $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:BlackRobeRising/vagrant-lemp-redis-stack.git lemp && cd lemp && vagrant up

## Where do you put your web app?
 * ./www - This is the directory that is mounted onto /var/www/ in the VM [/var/www/dev.local/htdocs is the full path of the default dev site]
 * ./srv - This is just gets mounted on /srv in case you need additional stuff [e.g. adding an irc bot]
